# Scientiic Computing

## Authors:

* Allen Goodman (@0x00b1)

## Summary

A “meta” Request for Comments (RFC) publication for PyTorch RFC publications on 
scientific computing, e.g.,

* Geometry
* Integration
* Interpolation
* Linear Algebra
* Machine Learning
* Optimization
* Probability Distributions
* Signal Processing
* Special Functions

This publication is a source for standard components of scientific computing 
RFC publications (e.g., motivation, metrics, references, etc.).

## Motivation

PyTorch must adapt quickly to new and existing programming languages and 
frameworks to stay relevant in the machine learning community; therefore, it 
must improve its general-purpose scientific computing capabilities to keep pace 
with the following expectations:

* machine learning researchers and practitioners expect the scope of primitive 
  PyTorch operators to widen as the field of machine learning widens (e.g., 
  solving differential equations or providing geometric constraints).
* scientists and engineers expect machine learning methods to complement 
  classic methods, relying on hybrid models that combine traditional techniques 
  and machine learning components.
