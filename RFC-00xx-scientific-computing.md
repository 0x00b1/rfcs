# Scientiic Computing

## Authors:

* Allen Goodman (@0x00b1)

## Summary

A “meta” Request for Comments (RFC) publication for PyTorch RFC publications on 
scientific computing, e.g.,

* Geometry
* Integration
* Interpolation
* Linear Algebra
* Machine Learning
* Optimization
* Probability Distributions
* Signal Processing
* Special Functions

This publication is a source for standard components of scientific computing 
RFC publications (e.g., motivation, metrics, references, etc.).

## Motivation

PyTorch needs to adapt quickly to new and existing programming languages and 
frameworks to stay relevant in the machine learning community. Today we're 
missing out on a massive area: general-purpose scientific computing.
